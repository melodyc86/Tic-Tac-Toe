# Tic-Tac-Toe

- **TicTacToe:**  is made using PyGame. it is a more creative visual tool, allowing the user to customize the player color and click the grid they wish to play instead of typing the coordinates.

- **TicTacToeBasic:**  is made solely using basic Python. It's an easier and shorter version than the one that utilizes PyGame and ensures that the user understands how indexing and conditional statements work.

#Recommendation:
- Start off with the "Basic" version until the concepts are comfortable to you. Then move on to PyGame when you're ready to incorporate its distinct features.
